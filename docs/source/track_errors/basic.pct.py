# ## Nodes
# ### True Positive
# A true positive node is defined as a predicted node that matches to only one
# ground truth node. Additionally, the corresponding ground truth node cannot be
# matched to more than one predicted node. True positives are annotated on both
# the ground truth and the division graph.

# %% [markdown]
# ### False Positive
# A false positive node is a node on the predicted graph does not match to a
# node on the ground truth graph. False positives are annotated on the predicted
# graph.

# %%
plot_matched([ex_graphs.fp_edge_matched(1)], [{7: "FP", 8: "FP"}], "", [""])

# %% [markdown]
# ### False Negative
# A false negative node is a node on the ground truth graph that is not matched
# to a predicted node. False negatives are annotated on the ground truth graph.

# %%
plot_matched([ex_graphs.fn_node_matched(2)], [{3: "FN"}], "", [""])


# %% [markdown]
# ## Edges
# ### True Positive
# An edge in the ground truth is a true positive edge if both source and target
# node are true positives and the corresponding edge is present in the
# prediction. True positive edges are annotated on both the ground truth and the
# predicted graph.

# %% [markdown]
# ### False Positive
# False positive edges occur in and are annotated on the predicted graph. A
# false positive edge can occur in several different scenarios when the edge
# fails to meet the criteria for a true positive.
#
# - Ex 1: Nodes 7 and 8 are not matched to any node in the GT.
# - Ex 2: While Nodes 5 and 6 are matched to nodes in the GT, an edge does not
#   exist between the corresponding GT nodes 2 and 3.
# - Ex 3: Node 6 is not matched to a node in the GT.
