## True Positive

A true positive division is a division event in which the parent and both daughters match between the ground truth and predicted graphs. True positive divisions are annotated on the parent node on both the ground truth and predicted graphs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched([ex_graphs.good_div(1)], [{2: "TP", 6: "TP"}], "", [""])
```

The `frame_buffer` parameter allows for divisions to be classified as true positives if they occur within the specified number of frames of tolerance. This feature is useful in cases where the exact frame that a division event occurs is somewhat arbitrary due to a high frame rate or variable segmentation or detection.

For the given ground truth graph, the subsequent predicted graphs show examples of true positive divisions events with different `frame_buffer` specifications.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [ex_graphs.div_1early_mid(), ex_graphs.div_1late_mid()],
    [{9: "TP", 3: "TP"}, {2: "TP", 11: "TP"}],
    "Frame buffer = 1",
    ["Early Division", "Late Division"]
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [ex_graphs.div_2early_mid(), ex_graphs.div_2late_mid()],
    [{8: "TP", 4: "TP"}, {2: "TP", 12: "TP"}],
    "Frame buffer = 2",
    ["Early Division", "Late Division"]
)
```

After classifying basic division errors, we consider all false positive and false negative divisions. If a pair of errors occurs within the specified frame buffer, the pair is considered a true positive division if the parent nodes and daughter nodes match. We determine the "parent node" of the late division by traversing back along the graph until we find the node in the same frame as the parent node of the early division. We repeat the process for finding daughters of the early division, by advancing along the graph to find nodes in the same frame as the late division daughters.

## False Negative

A false negative division is any division event in the ground truth that is not matched to a division in the predicted graph. False negative divisions are annotated on the ground truth graph.

Given the ground truth graph below, each of the subsequent prediction graphs would be classified as a false negative division.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [ex_graphs.one_child(1), ex_graphs.no_children(1)],
    [{2: "FN"}, {2: "FN"}],
    "",
    ["Missing daughter", "Missing daughters"]
)

```

## False Positive

A false positive division is any division event in the predicted graph that does not correspond to a division in the ground truth graph. False positive divisions are annotated on the predicted graph.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [ex_graphs.fp_div(1)],
    [{6: "FP"}],
    "",
    ["No division"]
)
```

## Wrong Child

A wrong child division is one where the parent node is correctly matched and identified as a division, but either one or both daughters do not match. This error is annotated on both the ground truth and the predicted graph.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [ex_graphs.wrong_child(1), ex_graphs.wrong_children(1)],
    [{2: "WC", 7: "WC"}, {2: "WC", 6: "WC"}],
    "",
    ["One wrong daughter", "Two wrong daughters"]
)
```
