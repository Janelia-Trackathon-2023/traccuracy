CTC Errors
==========

These node and edge error annotations are used to calculate the CTC metrics TRA and DET as well as the basic AOGM metric as described in :doc:`../metrics/ctc`.

Nodes
-----

True Positives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A true positive node is one that is matched to only one node in the predicted graph. Additionally, the predicted node is not matched to any other node in the ground truth. True positive nodes are annotated on both the ground truth and the predicted graph.

False Positives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False positive nodes are annotated on the predicted graph and correspond to a predicted node without a match in the ground truth graph.

False Negatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False negative nodes are annotated on the ground truth graph and correspond to a ground truth node without a match in the predicted graph.

Non-Split
^^^^^^^^^

Non-split nodes are annotated on the predicted graph and correspond to a node in the prediction that has been matched to two nodes in the ground truth graph.

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    plot_matched([ex_graphs.two_to_one(t) for t in [0, 1]], [{4: "NS"}, {5: "NS"}], "Non-Split Nodes")


Edges
-----

False Positives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False positive edges are annotated on the predicted graph. An edge is considered a false positive if both nodes are true positive nodes, but the edge does not match to any edge in the ground truth graph. In the example below, edge (4, 8) is a false positive.

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    # plot_matched([ex_graphs.crossover_edge()], [{}], "")

False Negatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False negative edges are annotated on the ground truth graph. An edge is considered a false negative if:

1. Either node is annotated as false negative nodes

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    plot_matched([ex_graphs.fn_node_matched(0)], [{1: "FN", (1, 2): "FN"}], "")

2. The corresponding edge in the predicted graph does not exist between two true positive nodes

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    plot_matched([ex_graphs.fn_edge_matched(0)], [{(1, 2): "FN"}], "")

3. Either node matches to a non-split node in the predicted graph

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    plot_matched([ex_graphs.two_to_one(t) for t in [0, 1]], [{4: "NS", (1, 2): "FN"}, {5: "NS", (1, 7): "FN", (2, 3): "FN"}], "")

Intertrack
^^^^^^^^^^

Intertrack edges connect parent cells to daughter cells.

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    div_graph = ex_graphs.basic_division(1)
    matched = Matched(div_graph, TrackingGraph(nx.DiGraph()), [], {})
    plot_matched([matched], [{(2, 3): "IT", (2, 4): "IT"}], "")


Wrong Semantic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After identifying a matched pair of edges from the ground truth and predicted graphs, the predicted edge is annotated as wrong semantic if the ground truth and predicted edge have different intertrack edge annotations.

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    plot_matched(
       [ex_graphs.fp_div(1), ex_graphs.one_child(1)],
       [{(6, 7): "WS"}, {(2, 3): "WS"}], 
       ""
    )
