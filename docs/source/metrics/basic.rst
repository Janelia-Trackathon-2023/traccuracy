Basic Performance Metrics
=========================

Basic performance metrics are computed based on the error classifications described in :doc:`../track_errors/basic`. 

For both nodes and edges, the following counts are returned:

* Total ground truth
* Total predicted
* True positives
* False positives
* False negatives

Using these counts, the following summary stastics are computed for both nodes and edges:

* Recall
* Precision
* F1 Score
