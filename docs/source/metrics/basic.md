# Basic Performance Metrics

Basic performance metrics are computed based on the error classifications described in {doc}`../track_errors/basic`.

For both nodes and edges, the following counts are returned:

- Total ground truth
- Total predicted
- True positives
- False positives
- False negatives

Using these counts, the following summary stastics are computed for both nodes and edges:

- Recall
- Precision
- F1 Score
