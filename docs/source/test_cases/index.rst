Test Cases
==========

Traccuracy errors and metrics are intended to be reliable and interpretable. To this end, we have developed a suite of standardized test cases against which all matchers and error assignment method should be tested. Each of these test cases give the developer an opportunity to explicitly determine and test the behavior of the method on a variety of test cases. New matchers, errors, and metrics should be tested against all cases to which they can feasibly be applied. 

The following pages include examples and illustrations of each of the test cases which should be considered:
