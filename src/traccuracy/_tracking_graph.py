    Nodes represent cell detections and edges represent links between detections in the same track.

    location (defaults to 'x' and 'y'). As in networkx, every cell must have a unique id, but these
    can be of any (hashable) type.

    We provide common functions for accessing parts of the track graph, for example
    all nodes in a certain frame, or all previous or next edges for a given node.
    Additional functionality can be accessed by querying the stored networkx graph
    with native networkx functions.

    Currently it is assumed that the structure of the networkx graph as well as the
    time frame and location of each node is not mutated after construction,
    although non-spatiotemporal attributes of nodes and edges can be modified freely.

    Attributes:
        start_frame: int, the first frame with a node in the graph
        end_frame: int, the end of the span of frames containing nodes
