    """A one-to-one matcher that uses Hungarian matching to minimize global
    distance of node pairs with a maximum distance threshold beyond which nodes
    will not be matched.
    Note: this matcher computes the Euclidean distance based on the location on the
    points. If the data is not isotropic, the scale parameter can be used to rescale
    the locations in each dimension to reflect "real-world" distances.

    Args:
        threshold (float): The maximum distance to allow node matchings (inclusive), in
            (potentially rescaled) pixels.
        scale_factor (tuple[float, ...] | list[float] | None, optional):  If provided,
            multiply the node locations by the scale factor in each dimension before
            computing the distance. Useful if the data is not isotropic to ensure that
            distances are computed in a space that reflects real world distances.
